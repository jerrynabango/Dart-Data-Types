## Data Types in Dart

### What are Data Types?

In programming, data types are like labels that tell the computer what kind of data we're working with. Just like we have different types of things in real life (like numbers, words, and lists), we also have different types of data in programming.

### Common Data Types in Dart:

1. **String**: This is for storing text. It could be a single word, a sentence, or even a paragraph.

2. **Integer**: This is for storing whole numbers, like 1, 2, 3, and so on.

3. **Double**: This is for storing numbers with decimal points, like 3.14 or 2.718.

4. **List**: This is like a container that can hold multiple items. It's like a shopping list where you can add or remove things.

5. **Map**: This is like a dictionary where you have a key and a value. For example, you can have a key called "name" and its value could be "John".

### Getting Started with Dart

This guide will help you get started with Dart programming language by cloning a sample project, navigating to the project directory, and running a Dart file.

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure that you have Dart SDK installed on your machine. You can download and install Dart SDK from the [official Dart website](https://dart.dev/get-dart).

### Cloning the Project

To clone the sample Dart project from GitHub, follow these steps:

1. Open your terminal or command prompt.

2. Use the `cd` command to navigate to the directory where you want to clone the project.

3. Run the following command to clone the project:

   ```
   git clone https://github.com/jerrynabango/Dart-Data_Types.git
   ```

   Replace `your-username` with your GitHub username and `your-dart-project` with the name of your Dart project repository.

### Navigating to the Project Directory

Once you have cloned the project, navigate to the project directory using the `cd` command:

```
cd your-dart-project
```

Replace `your-dart-project` with the name of your Dart project directory.

### Running the Dart File

After navigating to the project directory, you can run the Dart file using the `dart` command. For example, if your Dart file is named `data_types.dart`, run the following command:

```
dart data_types.dart
```

### Expected Output

- Player Name: Lionel Messi
- Club: Paris Saint-Germain
- Skills: [Dribbling, Passing, Shooting]
- Goals: [30, 25, 20]
- Age: 34
- Shirt Number: 30
- Nationalities: {ARG: Argentina, FRA: France, ESP: Spain}
- Assists: {La Liga: 200, Champions League: 3}
- Height: 1.7 meters
- Weight: 72.5 kg
- Is the player injured? false
- Is the player a captain? true

Replace `data_types.dart` with the name of your Dart file.

### Congratulations!

You have successfully cloned the sample Dart project, navigated to the project directory, and run the Dart file.
